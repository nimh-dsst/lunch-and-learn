### Introduction

This week DSST discussed the basic principles behind functional MRI (fMRI).

#### Blood-Oxygen-Level Dependent (BOLD) Contrast

BOLD contrast is the fundamental mechanism behind functional MRI (fMRI) that allows us to indirectly measure brain activity. Here's how it works:

1. **Magnetic Properties of Blood**:
   - Oxygenated blood is diamagnetic (no free electrons)
   - Deoxygenated blood is paramagnetic (has 4 free electrons)
   - This difference in magnetic properties affects the local magnetic field

2. **The BOLD Effect**:
   - Deoxygenated blood creates local magnetic field inhomogeneities
   - This results in a reduced signal compared to oxygenated blood

3. **Neurovascular Coupling**:
   - Active neurons require more oxygen to function
   - The body responds by increasing blood flow to active regions
   - Initially, oxygen consumption increases (more deoxygenated blood)
   - However, the increase in blood flow exceeds the oxygen demand
   - This leads to a net decrease in deoxygenated blood in active regions
   - The BOLD signal peaks 4-6 seconds after neural activity (hemodynamic response)

4. **Important Considerations**:
   - BOLD signal reflects blood oxygenation, not direct neural activity
   - The signal could come from either excitatory or inhibitory neurons
   - The hemodynamic response creates a temporal delay
   - Multiple repetitions are needed for reliable detection
   - Careful experimental design is crucial
