# Teaching and Learning Data Science

2/25/2025, attendance: 4

## Introduction

Data science and programming can be hard. The data scientists and research software engineers in attendance discussed their best ways to learn and teach data science topics to others.

## Learning Data Science

A common theme among the group was the first introduction for themselves being in-classroom or textbook learning followed thereafter by finding a project to work on. The project was either a real-world toy project that they were interested in solving or a problem they were asked to solve for work. This project-based learning approach was found to be more effective than traditional classroom learning, though the foundational programming topics learned in the classroom were essential to finding better solutions, considering data structures or code architecture.

## Teaching Data Science

When asked to help with a problem at work, the group had insightful ideas on whether to help colleagues by either giving them:

- An exact answer or code snippet
- A self-directed learning path
- An individual-oriented paired programming session
- A group-oriented interactive workshop
- An audience-directed presentation

It was further discussed the choice of how to answer depends on many factors:

- The dependent project's timeline
- The colleague's prior experience or skill level
- The colleague's desire to learn the topic
- Your own involvement in the project
- The colleague's preference for interactively solving the problem or working independently
- Whether or not you have time for the inquiry
- Your own level of comfort with the topic
- Whether or not you have the time to answer then or soon
- The complexity of teaching the topic

## Resources

Naturally, this topic couldn't be complete without discussing some specific resources, and a wealth of them were shared.
