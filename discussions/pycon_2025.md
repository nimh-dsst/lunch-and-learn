# PyCon US 2025

6/10/2025, attendance: 7


Jeff attended PyCon US 2025 in Pittsburgh and was kind enough to share his experience and highlights from some of the talks. The conference kicks off with 2 days of pre-conference paid tutorials (did not attend but have heard good things). The conference itself is 1 day of Sponsor Presentations and 3 days of talks covering a wide range of topics and catered to different levels of Python experience. It is followed by a 4 day post conference code sprint. For full details see the conference [website](https://us.pycon.org/2025/).

Recorded talks from PyCon 2025 can be found [here](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL2Uw4_HvXqvb98mQjN0-rYQjdDxJ_hcrs).

PyCon is a great opportunity to meet like minded people and learn something new. With a friendly atmosphere and something for everybody, PyCon is highly recommended. Next year PyCon will be held in May 2026 in Long Beach, keep your eyes peeled for more info. All Pythonistas should consider attending!
