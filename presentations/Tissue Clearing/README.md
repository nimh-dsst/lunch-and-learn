Josh gave a presentation on tissue clearing and the publication ["Achieving optical transparency in live animals with absorbing molecules."](https://doi.org/10.1126/science.adm6869). In this study, the authors demonstrated that a high concentration of the food dye tartrazine, also known as Yellow No. 5, turns the skin of mice transparent.
