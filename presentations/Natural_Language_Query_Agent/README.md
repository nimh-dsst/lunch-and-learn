# NIMH Data Science and Sharing Team Lunch and Learn (2025.04.08)

This presentation is a prototype for a larger project. This project aims to build a
framework for building intelligent data-driven applications. The goal is to make it easy
for data scientists and SQL-naive domain experts alike to build applications that can
answer questions about their data.
